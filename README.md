#Capstone_Project:-

**Introduction:-**
Identifying prospect customer is key to any business success. This prospect customers usually lie within the data.
Companies are using datascience to study hidden patterns and churn out essential information.
In the Capstone Starbucks project, I have tried to identify the target customers by plotting barcharts visualization.

**Libraries:-**

pandas,
numpy,
math,
json,
matplotlib,
sklearn

**Datasets:-**

portfolio = pd.read_json('data/portfolio.json', orient='records', lines=True),

profile = pd.read_json('data/profile.json', orient='records', lines=True),

transcript = pd.read_json('data/transcript.json', orient='records', lines=True)

**Conclusion:-**

Age group 45-65:- The key age group that Starbucks should focus is between 45-65, particularly age group between 50 to 60. The data shows maximum population for this age group. The reason of this could be stability in career or high disposable income or kind of loyal professional customer who drink only starbucks coffee. This is my personal experience, I have seen many professionals in wallstreets who drink only starbucks coffee everyday no other coffee brand.
Age group 30-40 :- The lowest customer range for starbucks is between age group 30-40. This is little younger group than the above. May be this age group is not very much into cofee or may be going for a cheaper brand.
Gender:- The provided data set has more Male population than female.
Channels of communication:-Buy one get one offers are sent mainly through email and mobile, this is the right thing to do, as most of the people carry smart phone, so its easy to produce and avail the offer.The means for sharing discount offer is maily through web and email.
Offers:- Age group 50-60 receives maxium offer and hence conversion is also heightest for this category.Seems starbucks is little aggresive on BOGO offers than discounts.Although Starbucks is more aggresive on BOGO offers, however our analysis shows that the conversion rate of Discount offer is more than BOGO.
Offer conversion:- Although the database has more male population, however the offers were sent more to female population and hence the conversion of female population is more.
Performance:- Year 2017 showed an excellent conversion, whereas the following year 2018 is similar to 2016. Starbucks may need to ponder on what it did differently in 2017. Was there any new product or offer or was there any change in taste of the product?
Spending:- Regarding spending, it is found that the femalepopulation spends more than male. 50 to 70 age group female spend the most.

#Recommendations:-

Age group 50-60 is Starbucks strong hold,especially female. Discount offers seems to attract customers more. The conversion rate of discount offer is 93% whereas conversion rate
of discount offer is 69%. Starbucks should keep focusing on this group.
